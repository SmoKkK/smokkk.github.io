## Who am I?

My persona is "**Inspektor Sorin**", I wish to remain as undercover as possible.

## What do I do?

I'm a guy in my 20's from the balkans trying to learn anything online security related from reverse engineering to better security practices while sharing my experience, thoughts and discoveries with a high interest in what I call under the table software (for example game cheats)

## My background

The first time when I have encountered anything related to this was in the skype era back in 2015, when while being in a Call of Duty game and I got DDoS'd. I was so curious about how that happened and worked so I decided to learn about botnets, attack methods and Firewall bypasses. Fast forward to 2022 and and many "skid attacks" I've done for the first time my first actual real high-scale attack

The video went small scale viral, motivating me to do similar videos which you can see [on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@inspektoriisrl/)

After only a few months, after some childish internet drama I've dipped my feet for the first time into reverse engineering, leading to me cracking a valorant cheat

# Why did I make this blog?

I've decided after these years to point my passion and skills to greater good by helping out people thru posts and tips rather than continuing in illegality
